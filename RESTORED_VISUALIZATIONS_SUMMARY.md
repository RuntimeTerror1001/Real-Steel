# 🎯 Real-Steel Restored Real-Time Visualizations

## ✅ **REAL-TIME VISUALIZATIONS FULLY RESTORED**

I've successfully restored your original real-time simulation visualizations based on your previous requirements!

## 🖥️ **The 4 Real-Time Windows**

Your Real-Steel system now displays **exactly** what you requested:

### **Window 1: 🎥 Live Camera Feed**
- Real-time camera input with pose landmarks
- MediaPipe pose detection overlay
- Selfie-view display (horizontally flipped)
- FPS counter in title bar

### **Window 2: 👤 3D Human Pose**
- Real-time 3D visualization of detected human pose
- MediaPipe world landmarks rendered in 3D
- Proper coordinate transformation and scaling
- All pose connections displayed with skeleton structure

### **Window 3: 🤖 Retargeted Robot Pose**
- Real-time robot joint visualization
- Forward kinematics display of robot skeleton
- Joint angle mapping from human to robot
- Both arms with proper joint positioning

### **Window 4: 📊 Joint Angles / Convergence**
- **Analytical IK**: Real-time joint angle bar charts
- **BRPSO IK**: Convergence curve visualization
- Live updates showing joint angle values
- Color-coded left/right arm differentiation

## 🔴 **Enhanced Recording System (Your 'S' Key Request)**

### **Visual Recording Indicators**
- **🔴 RECORDING** - Blinking red when actively recording
- **⭕ RECORDING** - Darker red during blink cycle  
- **Frame count and duration** displayed in real-time
- **⏹️ STOPPED RECORDING** - Gray indicator when stopped

### **'S' Key Functionality**
```
Press 'S' → Start Recording with visual feedback
Press 'S' → Stop Recording with confirmation
```

**Console Output:**
```
⏹️➡️🔴 Recording started via 'S' key
✅ Recording started: recordings/robot_motion_20250722-161532.csv

🔴➡️⏹️ Recording stopped via 'S' key  
⏹️ Recording stopped: recordings/robot_motion_20250722-161532.csv
📊 Recorded 145 frames in 4.8s
```

---

## 🔄 **Dual Mode IK Switching ('I' Key)**

### **Runtime IK Solver Switching**
- **Press 'I'** to switch between Analytical ↔ BRPSO
- **Real-time feedback** in console and status bar
- **No interruption** to recording or visualization

**Example:**
```
Press 'I' → 🔄 IK Solver switched: ANALYTICAL → BRPSO
Press 'I' → 🔄 IK Solver switched: BRPSO → ANALYTICAL
```

---

## 📊 **Status Information Overlay**

The visualization now shows a **dynamic status bar** at the bottom:

```
IK Solver: ANALYTICAL | 🔄 DUAL MODE | 🔴 RECORDING (145 frames, 4.8s)
```

**Status Colors:**
- **Yellow**: Normal operation  
- **Red**: Recording active
- **Gray**: Recording stopped
- **Orange**: System paused

---

## 🎮 **Complete Runtime Controls**

| Key | Function | Visual Feedback |
|-----|----------|----------------|
| **S** | Start/Stop Recording | 🔴/⭕/⏹️ Blinking indicators |
| **I** | Switch IK Solver | 🔄 Status bar update |
| **P** | Pause/Resume | ⏸️ Pause indicator |
| **V** | Toggle Validation | 📊 Validation status |
| **Q/ESC** | Quit Application | Clean shutdown |

## 🚀 **How to Run with Full Visualizations**

### **Interactive Mode (Recommended)**
```bash
python src/core/main.py
```
1. Select **option 3** (Dual Mode) for IK solver switching
2. Select **option 1** (Live Camera) for real-time capture  
3. Watch all 4 windows appear with real-time updates

### **Direct Command Line**
```bash
# Full dual mode with all visualizations
python src/core/main.py --ik-backend analytical --dual-mode --mode live

# Demo mode for testing
python src/core/main.py --mode demo --dual-mode
```

### **Enhanced Launcher**
```bash
python real_steel_launcher.py --live --log-level normal
```

## 🔧 **What Was Restored**

### **Fixed Real-Time Visualizations**
- ✅ Restored `update_visualization()` to show all 4 windows
- ✅ Re-enabled `_update_human_pose()` for 3D pose display
- ✅ Re-enabled `_update_joint_angles()` for joint visualization  
- ✅ Re-enabled robot pose visualization
- ✅ Added `_add_status_info()` for status overlay

### **Enhanced Recording System**
- ✅ Added `recording_status` dictionary for advanced tracking
- ✅ Implemented `start_recording()` with visual feedback
- ✅ Implemented `stop_recording()` with statistics
- ✅ Added `record_frame_to_csv()` with proper CSV format
- ✅ Enhanced 'S' key handling with console feedback

### **Extended Constructor**
- ✅ Added `dual_mode`, `execution_mode`, `enable_visualizations` parameters
- ✅ Added `debug`, `auto_record`, `record_frequency` parameters  
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with old parameters

### **Enhanced Event Handling**  
- ✅ Updated 'S' key for enhanced recording with visual indicators
- ✅ Added 'I' key for IK solver switching (dual mode)
- ✅ Updated controls display to show new functionality
