## üèÜ Recommendation

**Use BRPSO for Real-Steel boxing robot production** due to:

1. **Superior accuracy** critical for realistic boxing movements
2. **Reliable performance** in complex boxing poses
3. **Better constraint handling** for joint limits and rapid motions
4. **Acceptable real-time performance** for boxing applications
5. **Consistent convergence** and predictable behavior

The 111x speed penalty is justified by the 98.6% accuracy improvement and superior success rates in boxing-specific scenarios.
